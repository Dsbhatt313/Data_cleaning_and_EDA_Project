This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks detailing the process of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Indian credit card transaction data. The dataset used in this project provides insights into credit card transactions conducted by customers in India, including details such as transaction amount, merchant category, transaction date, and more.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates in the dataset.
Perform data type conversion, standardization, and normalization as necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct comprehensive analysis of the dataset to gain insights into transaction patterns, trends, and anomalies.
Visualize key metrics and distributions using plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
Explore relationships between variables and identify potential correlations.

Insights and Findings:
Summarize key findings from the EDA process, including notable trends, outliers, and patterns observed in the data.
Discuss potential implications for stakeholders and areas for further analysis or investigation.

Tools and Libraries:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
